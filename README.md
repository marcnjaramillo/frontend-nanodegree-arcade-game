#Classic Arcade Game - Frogger Clone
This clone of the classic game _Frogger_  was created using HTML5 canvas.
Gameplay only requires very simple inputs - up, down, left, and right.

##Object of the Game
Just like in _Frogger_, the player must get the character from one side of the
board to the other without running into objects - in this case, adorable
ladybugs.

###Controls
This is a very simple game. All a user needs to use is the arrow keys.
