#Classic Arcade Game - Frogger Clone
This clone of the classic game _Frogger_  was created using HTML5 canvas.
Gameplay only requires very simple inputs - up, down, left, and right.

##Requirements
The game can be accessed by opening index.html in a web browser. User must have
a working internet connection for gameplay. The game uses several JS files (app.js,
engine.js, resources.js) as well as images. In order for the game to work, the
HTML file must be linked to these sources.

##Object of the Game
Just like in _Frogger_, the player must get the character from one side of the
board to the other without running into objects - in this case, adorable
ladybugs.

###Controls
This is a very simple game. All a user needs to use is the arrow keys.
